# Airline Bookings Project
### Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop classification models to predict airline booking completion based on various factors.

### Dataset:
The dataset we will be using is from Kaggle, which includes 13 factors related to airline bookings and 50,000 records indicating whether a booking was completed.

### Techniques:
The techniques that will be used for our classification models are Naive Bayes and Random Forest algorithms to predict whether an airline booking will be completed.
After creating the models, we will use classification metrics and 10-fold cross-validation to assess and compare the performance of the models.
