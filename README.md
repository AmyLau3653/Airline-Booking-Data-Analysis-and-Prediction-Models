# Airline Bookings Project
## Project Introduction
For this project, our goal is to classify the possible complications of a myocardial infarction (MI), or heart attack based on various patient attributes. The dataset we will be using is from the Kaggle, and it contains information on airline booking factors, as well as whether a booking was completed. There are 13 airline booking factors and 50,000 rows of data. The techniques that will be used for our classification models are Naive Bayes and Random Forest. After creating two different classication models, we will compare and analyze them using classification metrics and 10-fold-cross-validation.
