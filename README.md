# Airline Bookings Project
## Project Description: Predicting Airline Booking Completion
### Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop classification models to predict airline booking completion based on various factors.

### Dataset:
The dataset we will be using is from Kaggle, which includes 13 factors related to airline bookings and 50,000 records indicating whether a booking was completed.

### Techniques:
Classification Models: Implemented Naive Bayes and Random Forest algorithms to predict whether an airline booking will be completed.
Evaluation: Used classification metrics and 10-fold cross-validation to assess and compare the performance of the models.
