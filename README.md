# Airline Bookings Project
## Project Introduction
For this project, our goal is to classify , or heart attack based on various patient attributes. The dataset we will be using is from the Kaggle, and it contains information on airline booking factors, as well as whether a booking was completed. There are 13 airline booking factors and 50,000 rows of data. The techniques that will be used for our classification models are Naive Bayes and Random Forest. After creating two different classication models, we will compare and analyze them using classification metrics and 10-fold-cross-validation. 
## Project Description: Predicting Airline Booking Completion
### Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop classification models to predict airline booking completion based on various factors.

### Dataset:
The dataset we will be using is from Kaggle, which includes 13 factors related to airline bookings and 50,000 records indicating whether a booking was completed.

### Techniques:
Classification Models: Implemented Naive Bayes and Random Forest algorithms to predict whether an airline booking will be completed.
Evaluation: Used classification metrics and 10-fold cross-validation to assess and compare the performance of the models.
Note: Detailed documentation, code implementation, and dataset specifics are available in the respective folders.
